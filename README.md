# Balanced-MNIST
Implementation of MLP and CNN along with hyperparameter tuning of both the models on the MNIST dataset
The code is implemented in PyTorch and covers all the major aspects of the API, such as Datasets, DataLoaders, Tensors etc.
There is an in-depth hyper-parameter tuning done for both the models (MLP and CNN), such as checking various optimizers, activation functions, learning rates, hidden layers etc. 
Data used is Balanced-MNIST, which can be downloaded from Pytorch Dataset library
Evaluation of the models is done on Accuracy score
